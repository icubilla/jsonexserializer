#summary Serializer Performance Statistics

= Introduction =

The JsonExSerializer has similar performance characteristics to the XmlSerializer and BinaryFormatter available with the .NET framework.  

= Details =

The performance tests serialize an object graph consisting of about 100 objects, made up of a "Customer" object containing "Address" and "Order" collections.  Each "Order" in the "Orders" collection contains 0 or more "OrderItem" objects.  The results are shown below.

Each test is 2500 iterations.

|| *Type* || *Serialization* || *Deserialization* ||
|| JsonExSerializer || 7.221ms per iteration || 12.477ms per iteration ||
|| BinaryFormmatter || 5.069ms per iteration || 2.809ms per iteration ||
|| XMLSerializer || 2.966ms per iteration || 1.816ms per iteration ||
