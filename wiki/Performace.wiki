#summary Serializer Performance Statistics

= Introduction =

The JsonExSerializer has similar performance characteristics to the XmlSerializer and BinaryFormatter available with the .NET framework.  

= Details =

The performance tests serialize an object graph consisting of about 100 objects, made up of a "Customer" object containing "Address" and "Order" collections.  Each "Order" in the "Orders" collection contains 0 or more "OrderItem" objects.  The results are shown below.

Each test is 2500 iterations.
